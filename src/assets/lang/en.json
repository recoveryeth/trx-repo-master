    "content_3": "In the past history, in the traditional centralized application, we have witnessed a series of unexpected endings caused by various problems that should not occur. Various uncertain human factors have caused the entire platform to cease to exist, leaving many \n'S followers are suffering hard to choose. \nIf you want to solve these factors and problems, you must have a distributed application that cannot be closed, tampered with, and open and transparent. \nTRON PROFESSIONAL SMART CONTRACT DISTRIBUTED DIGITAL GAME came into being in such a large environment. It is a decentralized network based on the innovative development of smart contract developers around the world. \nAn application that executes automatically.",
    "content_4": "REPO is the world's first decentralized application of lotto games based on the TRON network with multiple mechanisms. \nThe original intention of REPO design is to create a fair, just, transparent, deceptive, tamper-proof, and continuously running decentralized new smart contract platform. Those participating in the REPO game only support the use of USDT, in-game rewards \nThe settlement withdrawal is USDT. The REPO deployed on the TRON network innovatively combines the six-layer protocol and the two-layer fund mechanism (distributed protocol, redemption protocol, REPO protocol, Bancor protocol, TOP protocol, treasure box protocol, insurance) \nFunds, ecological development funds), these first-in-one fusion designs truly achieve 100% of all participating USDT can be distributed to each community member, allowing each member to continuously precipitate and accumulate through time, quickly and justly amplify you \nThe number of USDT.",
    "content_5": "REPO participates in 100% distribution",
    "content_6": "The origin of REPO comes from the Reddit TRON Community Forum in the United States. The members come from the early evangelists of the global TRON community and the early development members of TRON and the development enthusiasts of global smart contracts. \nREPO is a decentralized smart contract platform with only global community operations and development, and no central controller. Every member of the REPO community is an evangelist, a participant, an operator and a developer. \nThe smart contract code related to REPO will be completely open source, which means that once it starts running, the relevant code triggered by the smart contract will be automatically executed, because as long as the TRON public chain exists, it will continue to run uninterrupted, so we believe \n REPO will be the best TRON  lotto game smart contract platform for you.",
    "content_7": "The multiple protocols and fund mechanisms unique to REPO are interrelated, balanced, and promote the prosperity of REPO. \nThe distributed protocol can allow your REPO quantity to increase through distributed digital logic games, the redemption protocol can let you enter and exit REPO freely and fully experience the charm of true smart contracts \nLinks are more valuable and simultaneously promote the price growth of REPO.The Bancor protocol can increase the distributed game operation cycle to form REPO. \nThe agreement can make everyone equal and continue to insist on the last participating 580 addresses to win the treasure chest, the insurance fund can keep REPO endless, and there is sufficient REPO to give back to the first community members to participate, the ecological development fund can make the world more \nThe developers of multi-smart contracts participate in the research and development and deployment of REPO global ecology, which can allow REPO to diversify, continue to grow, and continue to prosper, making REPO not only an explosive application in the TRON network! \nIt can also become a phenomenon-level application in the entire decentralized network!",
    "content_8": "With the emergence and continuous growth of REPO, it has the responsibility of changing the deficiencies of existing various centralized platforms, creating a new decentralized integrated ecosystem, and innovating the form of digital financial games to provide a future development for decentralized games \nCome to new possibilities, and change the fate of people through the implementation of real smart contracts, creating new distributed economic value!",
